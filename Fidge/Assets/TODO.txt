x Bugs x

x Level solver : Link levels might not have correct solutions (e.g. Link Level 2)
	Print out the solutions to make sure they're right
x Level solver : Revealed Level 3 can't find a solution
	Does it just take too long?

? Questions ?

? How are levels actually unlocked?
? Should tutorials be playable? (the first one?)
? Try some other input methods
? Timer and moves as score, not objectives
? Do Locks destroy keys?
? Think about monetization
	Free?
	Fixed price?
	Donation based?
	Microtransactions?
		Goodies (hints)?
		Level unlock?
	Ads? 
		Banner? 
		Optional videos for goodies? 
		Videos every n levels?
	Free first n levels, pay for the rest?

= Editor & Structure

= More shortcuts (with help toggle that lists them)
= Polish job on right-click menus and content adding
= More generic LevelElement & Content
