x Bugs x

x Performance issues on device
x Completion issues (Julian: "I noticed if you get the star within the time limit you win but if you get the stars and time runs out you lose") (only on mac?)
x Arrow and bubble placement different on phone / mac / probably different resolutions

x Level solver : Link levels might not have correct solutions (e.g. Link Level 2)
	Print out the solutions to make sure they're right
x Level solver : Revealed Level 3 can't find a solution
	Does it just take too long?
