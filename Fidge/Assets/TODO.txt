	- (figure out how many I give out for free)
	- figure out balance values (moves, time) + order

x Performance issues on device (due to UI being always active?)
x Arrow and bubble placement different on phone / mac / probably different resolutions
	x bubble placement on TraversalInput and TraversalModifiers is a bit weird

- VISUAL EFFECTS / ANIMATION

	- Panel change/show
	- Traversal input
	- Go
	- Player "idle emphasis"
	- Player move
	- Level failed + reset
	- Level cleared
	- Level start : cover
	- level start: reveal

x Bugs x


x Julian: "If the player hits "go" without making any moves, the level doesnt end"
x Completion issues (Julian: "I noticed if you get the star within the time limit you win but if you get the stars and time runs out you lose") (only on mac?)


x Level solver : Link levels might not have correct solutions (e.g. Link Level 2)
	Print out the solutions to make sure they're right
x Level solver : Revealed Level 3 can't find a solution
	Does it just take too long?

++ Obstacles/features for levels

+ Non-uniform-to-grid path
	+ Twisted / weird direction
+ Crossing path
+ Buttons you have to land on to open a door on the level 
	+ making levels where you have more than one "go" to traverse it
	+ buttons could also activate/deactive other traps and obstacles
+ Multiple end nodes / possible traversal but only one optimal one
+ Cracks and walls with more than 1 health
+ Triggers that toggle paths on or off
+ Enemies with predictable patterns that you need to avoid
	+ Back and forth a set number of nodes
	+ Move in a square, a set number of nodes each direction
	+ Straight line & turn 180 degrees when they can't move straight ahead
	+ Straight line & turn 90 degrees when they can't move straight ahead
+ Usable "items" or "powers" that you collect and use in a sort of "stack"
